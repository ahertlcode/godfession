1). This API uses a single entry, so that every authentication and clean-up can be
    achieved in a single file. This mean that for every action that will be carried out only
    "serverSideProcessor.php" will be called.

2). Three key parameters must be sent with the required filters in the ajax request
    a. datamethod - The method to be called
    b. datakls - this should correspond with the database table name
    c. actualact - The actual action being carried out

3). The json array are sent to and received from the main API "serverSideProcessor.php".
    with all the name of every the name:value parameter corresponding to the database table
    column name except the id(primary key fields) that I prefix with the database name for
    identity sake. e.g users_id from users, admin_roles_id from admin_roles.

4). Every server side call follows the same front end process as the one in action.js

5). From the database structure I observed that records are never deleted at anytime, they
    are only updated with the is_deleted SET to 1

5). Endeavor to add the database password in server/utilities/dbrel.php before carrying out actions.

Thanks.
Please revert on any issue.
